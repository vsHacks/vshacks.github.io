### Running with the Python web server

Running the website on a local web-server is useful for testing.

```
python3 -m http.server
```

### Using Live Preview

Alternatively, if you are using the Visual Studio Code editor for development,
you may install the [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension,
which will host a local server for you. To open a preview of the website to the side,
simply right-click on `index.html`.
